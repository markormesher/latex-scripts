\section{Important Notes About These Notes}

These notes were written by me, Mark Ormesher, during my revision for Computer Science exams at King's College London. I am publishing them here to help my classmates and other students in the years below me. To the best of my knowledge they are correct.

These notes are \b{not endorsed} by King's College London, the module lecturers, or any member of College staff. These notes are \b{not checked} by any qualified individual, and I offer no guarantee as to how accurate or complete these notes are. They are offered for free, as-is, and I accept no responsibility for how you choose to use them.

These notes were relevant for my year (2016/17) but \b{the content for your course may be different}. Check your lecture slides, syllabi, tutorial guides, etc.

These notes were produced for my own personal use (it's part of how I study and revise). That means that some annotations may by irrelevant to you, and \b{some topics might be skipped} entirely.

Feel free to \b{share} these notes, however please only share a link to the repo (see the link below), not individual files.
